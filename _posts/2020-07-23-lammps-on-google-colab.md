If you want to quickly try out LAMMPS without having to set up your own environment,
here is another option. Run it inside of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

I've created a small demo that shows how to compile LAMMPS for both stand-alone
usage, as well as with Python support enabled:
[Using Lammps Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IroIPnNj0lR49x9O7eWass4IvZc2XgPN?usp=sharing)

This was inspired by questions I got via Email. Kudos to Ting Tan from University of Vermont for motivating this.

Enjoy!
