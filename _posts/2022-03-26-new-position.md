After many good years at Temple University, it was time for me to move on and
look for new challenges.

On February 22, 2022 I started at Los Alamos National Lab as Scientist to work
on a new generation of HPC C++ codes such as <a href="https://flecsi.org/">FleCSI</a>
and DevOps in various other projects.
