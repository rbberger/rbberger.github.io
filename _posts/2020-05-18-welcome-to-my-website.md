If you ever find this website, chances are you just stumbled on some random
person's blog while searching for a solution for a technical problem online.
Been there many times myself. Welcome :-)

What you'll find here is my personal space online to host my resume, showcase
some of my projects and blog posts about topics that interest me. I've needed a
space to write down things I often need myself or I keep explaining to other
people over and over again. I also want to use it to go down the
memory lane to record certain things. It's best to write down stories when they
are fresh, and you'll never know who else can benefit from your own
experiences.

In that spirit, thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy some of the stuff
you find here.

Cheers,

Richard
